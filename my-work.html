                <p><em>EV Sales Forcast</em></p>
                <p>The research focuses on <strong>Forecasting the new energy vehicle market</strong> and analyzing key factors influencing purchase decisions using regression models, BP-LSTM, and decision trees. Experimental results indicate that the number of charging piles significantly impacts sales, and the BP-LSTM model achieves a mean square error of 2.525, while purchase reasons and travel distance influence consumer choices.</p>

                <p><em>Carbon Trading System</em></p>
                <p>This project is a <strong>Regional Carbon Resource Management Platform</strong>, designed to help enterprises comply with carbon trading regulations and emission control policies. It allows businesses to monitor carbon emissions, trade carbon credits, and receive credit ratings based on their environmental impact. The system integrates data visualization, transaction auditing, and government supervision to ensure compliance and facilitate fair carbon trading. Built using Spring Boot and Vue, it enhances transparency and efficiency in carbon resource management.</p>

                  <p><em>Biking Path Design</em></p>
                  <p>The <strong>Jackson County Biking Project</strong> aims to enhance biking infrastructure and promote cycling as both a recreational and commuting option in Jackson County, Wisconsin. The project collects and analyzes data from platforms like Strava, surveys, and local cyclist feedback to design a well-connected and accessible biking network. Key recommendations include developing long-distance routes, improving safety features, and integrating digital tools like interactive maps and mobile apps. The initiative also focuses on boosting local tourism and economic activity by connecting trails to businesses and points of interest.</p>
